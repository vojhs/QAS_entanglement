# QAS_entanglement
This repository contains is an implementation of the "General-purpose quantum architecture search based on deep reinforcement learning".
The base-line method referred "https://github.com/qdevpsi3/quantum-arch-search".
In this code, the version repository has been upgraded to: Cirq (v1.4.1), Stable-Baselines3 (v2.4.0), and Gymnasium (v1.0.0).
Furthermore, this program has re-implemented the fidelity calculation method, the influence of noise, and the applying method of the quantum gates.
